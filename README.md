# java-review
A Java code repository of review materials for technical interviews and refreshing basic knowledge

After my frist technical interview in almost a decade, I realized very fast that all of my basic
knowledge of web and Java development was VERY rusty.  The answers I gave were all true at the time
but I was not satisfied with any them.  Within an hour of the interview (an hour too late to give better
answers) and using just my memory, I was able to answer the exact same questions exponentialy better and 
realized some were answers were incorrect. It was abundabtly clear that I needed to "flex" my basic 
programming muscles.

This reposity will host questions I was either asked or have come up with on my own as well as my initial
answer and updated answers.  I will also post code and any web apps I write during this process.
